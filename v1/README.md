# Snow Product Version API Examples
API access to the Snow Software Product versions, available in raw, json or xml output for v1.

# Legacy
Please note that v1.0 is now considered a legacy API with v2.0 currently in development.  The information will continue to be updated, however it will eventually be killed off thus I recommend moving to v2.0 when available.

# API and Documentation
The API and it's documentation is available from [https://snwapi.com](https://snwapi.com/).
